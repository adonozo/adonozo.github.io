This project is the result of a joint effort by the [Iberoamerican Organization States](https://oei.int/oficinas/bolivia) and its multidisciplinary teams that include linguists, graphic designers, sound engineers, and developers. I personally contributed with the design and development of the Android application, and with the maintenance of the underlying service that makes the app work.

## Native Android ##

Some benefits of creating a native Android app are the small footprint, efficient memory usage, and access to peripherals. The app is available at the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bo.oei.lenguas.lenguas), but the server is no longer maintained so it may have a very limited functionality.

The app follows the [Activity Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle) and the [Fragment Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments/lifecycle). Besides, it uses libraries from the Android ecosystem which work nicely together. These includes:

- Retrofit
- RxJava
- Gson
- Room
- Dagger
